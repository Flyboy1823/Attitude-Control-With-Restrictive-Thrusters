# Attitude-Control-With-Restrictive-Thrusters
For deep space missions, total added impulse in an inertial frame might be the reference signal inputted.  With thrusters that have min and max on and off times, a robust control method must be designed.  This controller includes SMC and Bang-Bang with deadband control for angular velocity and attitude as well as PFPW Modulations.
